## Schema

### Required

- **email** (String) The member's email address. A member can be a user or another group. This property is required when adding a member to a group. The email must be unique and cannot be an alias of another group. If the email address is changed, the API automatically reflects the email address changes.
- **group_id** (String) Identifies the group in the API request. The value can be the group's email address, group alias, or the unique group ID.

### Optional

- **delivery_settings** (String) Defines mail delivery preferences of member. Acceptable values are:`ALL_MAIL`: All messages, delivered as soon as they arrive. `DAILY`: No more than one message a day. `DIGEST`: Up to 25 messages bundled into a single message. `DISABLED`: Remove subscription. `NONE`: No messages. Defaults to `ALL_MAIL`.
- **role** (String) The member's role in a group. The API returns an error for cycles in group memberships. For example, if group1 is a member of group2, group2 cannot be a member of group1. Acceptable values are: `MANAGER`: This role is only available if the Google Groups for Business is enabled using the Admin Console. A `MANAGER` role can do everything done by an `OWNER` role except make a member an `OWNER` or delete the group. A group can have multiple `MANAGER` members. `MEMBER`: This role can subscribe to a group, view discussion archives, and view the group's membership list. `OWNER`: This role can send messages to the group, add or remove members, change member roles, change group's settings, and delete the group. An OWNER must be a member of the group. A group can have more than one OWNER. Defaults to `MEMBER`.
- **type** (String) The type of group member. Acceptable values are: `CUSTOMER`: The member represents all users in a domain. An email address is not returned and the ID returned is the customer ID. `GROUP`: The member is another group. `USER`: The member is a user. Defaults to `USER`.

### Read-Only

- **etag** (String) ETag of the resource.
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **member_id** (String) The unique ID of the group member. A member id can be used as a member request URI's memberKey.
