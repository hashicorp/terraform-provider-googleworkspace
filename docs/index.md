# Google Workspace Provider

  The Google Workspace provider provides resources to interact with Google Workspace.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "googleworkspace" {
  credentials             = "/Users/mscott/my-project-c633d7053aab.json"
  customer_id             = "A01b123xz"
  impersonated_user_email = "impersonated@example.com"
}
```

## Authentication

### Creating a Service Account and Credentials

Terraform will use a GCP service account to manage resources created by the provider. To create the service account and
generate a service account key see the documentation [here](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation#create_the_service_account_and_credentials).
Once the key has been generated, save the json file locally and set the `GOOGLEWORKSPACE_CREDENTIALS` environment
variable to the path of the service account key. Terraform will use that key for authentication.

### Configuring the Service Account

To access user data on a Google Workspace domain, the service account that you created needs to be granted access
by a super administrator for the domain. To delegate domain-wide authority to a service account, follow the instructions
[here](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation#delegate_domain-wide_authority_to_your_service_account).

* Note: The Oauth scopes granted to your service account must match, or be a superset, of the `oauth_scopes` granted to
the `googleworkspace` provider.

### Impersonating a Google Workspace User

Only users with access to the Admin APIs can access the Admin SDK Directory API, therefore your service account needs
to impersonate one of those users to access the Admin SDK Directory API. You can do this by granting the GCP IAM role
`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` to your service account, with member `user:<impersonated_user_email>`. This user's email
must be set in the environment variable `GOOGLEWORKSPACE_IMPERSONATED_USER_EMAIL` or in the `impersonated_user_email`
attribute in the provider. Additionally, the user must have logged in at least once and accepted the Google Workspace
Terms of Service.
