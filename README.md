![Status: Tech Preview](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-experimental-EAAA32) [![Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/release/hashicorp/terraform-provider-googleworkspace.svg)](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-googleworkspace/releases)
[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/github/license/hashicorp/terraform-provider-googleworkspace.svg)](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-googleworkspace/blob/main/LICENSE)![Unit tests](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-googleworkspace/workflows/Unit%20tests/badge.svg)

This Google Workspace provider for Terraform allows you to manage domains, users, and groups in your Google Workspace.

This provider is a technical preview, which means it's a community supported project. It still requires extensive testing and polishing to mature into a HashiCorp officially supported project. Please [file issues](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-googleworkspace/issues/new/choose) generously and detail your experience while using the provider. We welcome your feedback.

## Maintainers

This provider plugin is maintained by the Terraform team at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/)

## Requirements

-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 0.13.x
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.16

## Upgrading the provider

The Google Workspace provider doesn't upgrade automatically once you've started using it. After a new release you can run

```bash
terraform init -upgrade
```

to upgrade to the latest stable version of the Google Workspace provider. See the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#provider-versions)
for more information on provider upgrades, and how to set version constraints on your provider.

## Building The Provider

1. Clone the repository
1. Enter the repository directory
1. Build the provider using the Go `install` command or `make build`:
```sh
$ make build
```

## Adding Dependencies

This provider uses [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).
Please see the Go documentation for the most up to date information about using Go modules.

To add a new dependency `github.com/author/dependency` to your Terraform provider:

```
go get github.com/author/dependency
go mod tidy
```

Then commit the changes to `go.mod` and `go.sum`.

## Using The provider

See the [Google Workspace Provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/googleworkspace/latest/docs) to get started using the
Google Workspace provider.

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (see [Requirements](#requirements) above).
You can use [goenv](https://github.com/syndbg/goenv) to manage your Go version.
To compile the provider, run `go install`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

To generate or update documentation, run `go generate`.

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```sh
$ make testacc
```
